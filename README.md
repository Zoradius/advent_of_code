# Personal Advent of Code repo
This repo holds my personal attempts at solving the daily programming
problems found on the [advent of code website](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
for the year 2021. Everything will be written in Python
and if I'm disciplined enough everything should be sufficiently
commented. The actual problems will not be pasted here, please
see the above link for more details on that.
